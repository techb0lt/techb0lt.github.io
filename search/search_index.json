Going low carb helps one avoid the \"allergic reaction\" thus bringing blood glucose in normal range.</p> <p>I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in October'2010. Since then I followed all the advice on diet from doctors and health nutritionalists which can mostly be summarised thus:</p> <p>Popular yet incorrect advice</p> <ul> <li> Minimise fat intake</li> <li> Eat healthy unprocessed carbs, </li> <li> Eat small portions but eat frequently. </li> <li> Eat fruits but try eating those with low glycemic index. </li> <li> Live an active lifestyle - exercise often, lose weight.</li> </ul> <p>There were few variations to above advice but it generally follows this theme and except for one all others are just plain wrong advice for a diabetic. It did not help in the slightest to reduce my blood glucose reading and so I was to follow this diet along with Metformin - it started with 500mg and went all the way to 2000mg and when that did not help, I was to take this medication alongside Empagliflozin first 10mg and then 25 mg and then there was statin and Linagliptin added to the mix.</p> <p>While following the diet as recommended by professionals and exercising religiously helped tone my body but all that along with the cocktail of medication and even being a complete teetotaler did not make an iota of difference to my blood glucose readings. They were always way too high hovering between 80 to 100 mmol/mol on quarterly HbA1c results.</p> <p>The approach that worked for me, as explained below, was complete antithesis of what I was told:</p> <p>What works for me</p> <ul> <li> Don't eat frequently and instead fast frequently. </li> <li> When you eat, eat foods with low carbs. </li> <li> Avoid fruits as they have fructose which does not help. </li> <li> Increase intake of good fat to be able to continue with low carb diet</li> <li> Include optimum protien in diet. </li> <li> Drink lots of fluids. </li> <li> Stay active especially on fasting days (Exercise / Walks).</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "index.html#the-awakening", "title": "The Awakening", "text": "<p>Then in October'2020 after another high 86 mmol/mol HbA1c result, I was told that I will have to start taking insulin. This is not where I wanted to be in my early 40s and so, in desperation, I started doing my own reading on trusty old Google and came across the book named \"The diabetes code\" written by Dr. Jason Fung. </p> <p>I am a scribd subscriber and the book is readily available there as part of my subscription so there was no barrier to entry and I started reading it. The book explains the concept of diabetes in a simple way and gives the approach of tackling it by means intermittent fasting. The concept was new to me but the more I read the more sense it made. Along with intermittent fasting, the book also talked about reducing the carb intake.</p> <p>I decided that before I go for insulin, I would like to give this approach a try. So I talked with my wife and the diabetic team at my local surgery about what and how I wanted to proceed. We agreed to take a very careful approach around fasting and see how it goes one day at a time. </p>"}, {"location": "index.html#alternate-day-fasting", "title": "Alternate Day Fasting", "text": "<p>The book talks about Alternate Day Fasting (ADF), One Meal a Day (OMAD) and various other strategies but the ADF option appeared most logical for my use case, mainly because its simple to follow and I would be able to completely switch off food intake for a day rather than bother about cooking one meal each day or keep track of fasting hours and so on.</p> <p>In order to prepare for ADF, I first had to ensure that my body reduced relying on Carbs for energy requirements. I started initially by reducing carb intake with various food group experiments but the list below can get one started fairly quickly. Once the body is on low carb diet, it starts relying on fat store within the body for its energy source and it is at this point that starting to fast will become easier. </p> <p>After about 2 weeks of low carb diet, I started my Alternate day fasting and within a week my blood sugar readings were well within the good range (4 mmol/L to 7.5 mmol/L). At this point I was worried that the medication may get me into hypo, so I had a discussion with Diabetic Nurse and stopped medication altogether on 12/11/2020, atleast until my next HbA1c. </p>"}, {"location": "index.html#continuous-glucose-monitoring", "title": "Continuous Glucose Monitoring", "text": "<p>It will be worthwhile to mention that while I was doing all this, I also invested in Freestyle Libre and a transmitter called <code>miaomiao</code> which kind of converts the manual scan solution of Freestyle Libre into a full blown CGM sending data to my phone every 5 minutes. This was important as I was constantly monitoring the effects of each food group on my BG to eliminate any food that would cause a spike.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Now one does not need to invest in miaomiao transmitter because Freestyle Libre 2 can send data using bluetooth to a phone and so using an app called Diabox one can get data on phone every one minute. Tricky on iphone but pretty straightforward on Android  Latest Libre2 now sends data directly to official app every one minute via bluetooth without need to manually scan each time, so no transmitter or app needed.</p>"}, {"location": "index.html#conclusion", "title": "Conclusion", "text": "<p>So the final appraoch that I followed, comprised of two main objectives:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Fast every alternate day (minimum 36 hours fasting).</p> <ul> <li>On the day of fasting I ensured I was drinking lots of fluids (4.5 to 5 litres) in form of water, herbal tea, coffee and salted lemon water.</li> <li>On fasting days, atleast initially I would feel a bit lethargic but I aimed to walk atleast 1.5 miles (45 minutes) even if it was within the house itself. This became easier as my body got fat adapted and now am able to operate as normal and carry out extended workouts too.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>On non-Fasting day eat a low carb diet with an aim to not exceed the carbs intake by more than 80 gms.</p> <ul> <li>On the day I ate, I broke my fast after 36 or more hours with roughly 40g of extra mature cheddar cheese and then for the three meals during the rest of the day, I followed a combination of dishes in Recipes section of this site.</li> <li>I also tried to keep my non-fasting window between 7 to 12 hours. So if I broke fast at 08:00 AM, I would try to finish eating last meal of the day by 8.00 PM at the very latest.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Around end of Feb'21, I had my HbA1c test after following this for 3 months and for the first time in 10 years my HbA1c was in normal range at 39 mmol/mol that too without any medication whatsoever. This diet with fasting not only allowed me to avoid insulin, but has also resulted in weight loss. I am now about 14 Kgs lighter than when I started.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>The fasting part of this process is something each individual will need to tailor to their needs based on how their body is responding but the aim of the recipes on this site is merely to provide some useful vegetarian options that helped me stay low carb on the days I do eat. The nutritional part of concept is also explained succinctly on this link.</p>"}, {"location": "index.html#update-notes", "title": "Update Notes", "text": ""}, {"location": "Recipes/index.html", "title": "Content", "text": "<ol> <li> <p>Snacks and Sides</p> <ol> <li>Protein Cutlets</li> <li>Paneer Crackers</li> <li>Cheese Crackers</li> <li>Miso Aubergine And Mushroom Salad</li> <li>Salad For Pasta</li> <li>Tomato Keftedes</li> <li>Keto Potato</li> <li>Cheesy Bites</li> <li>Fries</li> <li>Fried Courgette</li> <li>Low Carb Edamame Falafels</li> <li>Minty Basil Mushroom Soup</li> <li>Cheesey Pops</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Main Meal Options</p> <ol> <li>Chutney Paneer</li> <li>Spicy Lauki</li> <li>Soya Malai</li> <li>Methi Malai Paneer</li> <li>Palak Mushroom</li> <li>Lahsuni Paneer</li> <li>Low Carb Pizza</li> <li>Baigan Bharta</li> <li>Fried Cauliflower</li> <li>Fried Okra</li> <li>Keto Gatte</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Breakfast Options</p> <ol> <li>Almond Bread</li> <li>Scrambled Tofu</li> <li>Keto Upma</li> <li>Keto Granola</li> <li>Flaxseed Porridge</li> <li>Keto Dhokla</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Breads</p> <ol> <li>Tava Roti</li> <li>Wheat Gluten Tava Roti</li> <li>Wheat Gluten Bread</li> <li>Naan Bread</li> <li>Tandoori Roti</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Dessert Options</p> <ol> <li>Chocolate Cookies</li> <li>Banana Bread</li> <li>Peanut Mugcake</li> <li>Protein Fudge</li> <li>Bottlegourd Halwa</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Dips</p> <ol> <li>Green Pesto</li> <li>Mint Spinach Dip</li> <li>Basil Mint Dip</li> <li>Tzatziki Dip</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Drinks</p> <ol> <li>Sparkling Cinnamon</li> <li>Spicy Milk</li> </ol> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "Recipes/00-prepare-to-beat.html", "title": "Prepare for diabetic diet", "text": ""}, {"location": "Recipes/00-prepare-to-beat.html#prepare", "title": "Prepare", "text": "<p>Prepare by having key ingredients to help with mostly vegetarian keto / low carb diet.

recipe_9_low_carb_pizza.jpg\n&gt;&gt; Image-Caption: Low Carb Pizza and Garlic Bread.\n\n**Common Prep Steps**\n\nAdd @Olive Oil{1%tbsp} and @sugar{1%tsp} in @water{300%ml} and mix well.\nTake a #bowl{} and add @vital wheat gluten{1%cup}.\nAdd @wheat bran{1/4%cup}, @oat flour{1/4%cup}.\nAdd @flax meal{1/4%cup}, @Almond Flour{1/2%cup}.\nAdd @baking powder{1%tsp}, @salt{1%tsp}, @dried yeast{7%gms(1 sachet)}.\nAdd liquid mix to dry mix and knead for ~{5%minutes}.\nOnce consolidated, place the dough on oiled #baking sheet{}.\nFlatten it with hand at first and with #roller pin{} later to bring it to about 14 inch diameter. \nIf you want your pizza to be round then using a #large round utensil{} as guide and #knife or pizza cutter{} trim uneven sides to get a circular shape else just use the #knife or pizza cutter{} to make a rectangular shape.\nCover it with a slightly damp cloth and keep it aside to rise.\nUse the trimmed dough to make another ball of dough and flatten it first with hand and then with roller pin to a size of roughly 8 to 10 inch.\nLet the two items rise for a ~{40-60%minutes} though leaving for about ~{2%hrs} gets better results.\n\n**Garlic Bread**\n\nTake the smaller base and Using a #fork{} pierce the base equidistantly.\nIn a #microwaveable bowl{} take @salted butter{30%gms}.\nUsing a #grater{}, grate @Garlic{3-4%cloves(Large)} into the #microwaveable bowl{}.\nPlace the #microwaveable bowl{} into #microwave{} for ~{20-30%seconds}.\nUsing an #oil brush or spatula{} spread the melted butter and Garlic onto the smaller pierced base.\nPut this into the #oven{} at 180\u00b0C for ~{10%minutes}.\nTake it out after that and cut it into rectangular pieces using #pizza cutter{}.\n\n**Pizza  Toppings**\n\nWhile any topping can be used, I started by cutting @Yellow Capsicum{35%gms(1/3)} with #knife{}.\nThen cut @Brown chestnut mushrooms{30%gms(3-4)}, @onion{50%gms(1/2)} and @canned pineapple{50%gms(1 ring)} using #knife{} and keep them separately for later use.\nCut @Paneer{125%gms} and put in a #small bowl{}.\nAdd @virgin olive oil{2%tsp}, @tandoori masala{2%tsp}, @dried fenugreek leaves{2%tsp} and @Pink Himalayan Salt{to taste} and mix well.\n\n**Pizza**\n\nTake the larger base and spread evenly [@pasta sauce{3%tbsp}](https://kutt.it/pesto-sauce) on it using #spatula{}.\nThen spread a thin layer of @grated mozzarella cheese{40%gms}.\nAdd all veggie pizza toppings as much as possible without piling up and arranged side to side.\nThen add paneer cubes, these can be piled on top of veggies, if there isn't enough space.\nNow spread evenly @grated extra mature cheddar cheese{50%gms}.\nThen add @jalapenos{10%gms(8-10 rings)}.\nFinally sprinkle some more @grated mozzarella cheese{20%gms}.\nPut this into the #oven{} at 180\u00b0C for ~{20%minutes}.\nTake it out after that and cut it using #pizza cutter{}.\n</code></pre>", "tags": ["Italian", "Bread", "Dinner", "Lunch"]}, {"location":

Say Grilled Hallumi Cheese with home made hummus or Fried eggs with one of the breads.</li> <li>Then I eat one of the dishes (or a variation of it) from the recipes section of this site.</li> <li>Finally, if I am still hungry then I eat some nuts with greek yogurt, raspeberries, pomegranate and a few freshly cut slices of any whole fruit such as peach, apple or pear.</li> </ul> <p>One observation from last few years is that my diet has reduced considerably and I am not able to eat as much as I used to. Part of it perhaps is down to fasting but mainly it is because I now eat whole foods which tend to make me feel satiated earlier and for longer than the addictive UPFs.</p> <p>I tend to eat a bit more carbs during my holidays but not huge amounts, just a tiny bit of indulgence - say have a slice of tiramissu here or a few slices of freshly baked pizza or some pasta there but that kind of behaviour is restricted to no more than two weeks in a year. If and when I do so, then after a week or two of my return from the break, I do undertake longer fasting (48 to 60 hrs).</p>"}, {"location": "resources/converter.html", "title": "HbA1c and BG Unit Converter", "text": "<p>Info</p> <p>Following conversion formula<sup>1</sup> is used: </p> <pre><code>IFCC = (DCCT - 2.15) * 10.929\n</code></pre> <p>This is an approximation for conversion based on what I understand. </p> <p>Additionally, an approximation of Average Blood Glucose based on DCCT HbA1c value are calculated using following formula:</p> <pre><code>Average Blood Glucose (mg/dl) = (A1C * 28.7) - 46.7\nAverage Blood Glucose (mmol/l) = (A1C * 1.59) - 2.04\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, entering value in one of the unit fields will also provide conversion to other unit using the formula as well as provide HbA1c values assuming the provided value is average BG measure in given unit:</p> <pre><code>BG in mg/dl = BG in mmol/l * 18\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Some explanation is available on NGSP Site:\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "resources/converter.html#hba1c", "title": "HbA1c", "text": "<ul> <li> <p>DCCT</p> <p> % (Percent)</p> </li> <li> <p>IFCC</p> <p> mmol/mol</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "resources/converter.html#average-blood-glucose", "title": "Average Blood Glucose\u00b6", "text": "<ul> <li> <p>Milligram per decilitre</p> <p>mg/dl</p> </li> <li> <p>Millimole per litre</p> <p> mmol/l</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "blog/archive/2024.html", "title": "2024", "text": ""}, {"location": "blog/category/updates.html", "title": "Updates", "text": ""}]}
